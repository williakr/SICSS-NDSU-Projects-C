## Project Summary

Information Collection Requests are one mechanism that federal governmental agencies use to solicit public input in policymaking. Essentially, the agency posts an announcement in the Federal Register defining the issues they’re looking for input on and the stakeholders they want to hear from. People submit their comments on the issue, and then the agency is tasked with processing all of the comments and responding to them as they revise the policy. Some agencies are interested in whether natural language processing tools can help to streamline this process so that the key insights from the public can be extracted without having to go through each comment by hand, which can be burdensome when the volume of comments is high.

In November 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted a Request for Comments from the general public of the United States on DHS use of facial recognition and other AI technology for border, customs, and TSA activities. Facial recognition and AI are controversial technologies with potential for misuse and bias. DHS states that the purpose of the RFC is “designing and deploying [AI] in a manner responsive to the public’s concerns.” Can NLP reliably be used to facilitate this process for public participation in government policymaking, or more generally as a substitute for hand-coded qualitative analysis?

## Data
